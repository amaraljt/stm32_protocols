# stm32_protocols

This is a testing playground for practicing communication protocols using the STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE.
I will be creating micro projects for each protocol to further my understanding of embedded systems/software.

# UART
For the UART protocol I will be using an stm32 as the transmitter and an esp32 as the receiver.


# SPI


# I2C


# CAN


# USB


# Bluetooth
